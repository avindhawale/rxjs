# RxJS Practice Repository

Welcome to my RxJS Practice repository! This repository is a collection of practice projects, exercises, and examples that help me learn and experiment with the powerful reactive programming library, RxJS.

## About RxJS

[RxJS](https://rxjs-dev.firebaseapp.com/) (Reactive Extensions for JavaScript) is a library for reactive programming using Observables. It makes it easy to work with asynchronous data streams, handle events, and manipulate streams of data using operators like `map`, `filter`, `merge`, and many others.

## Purpose

This repository serves as a learning playground for RxJS. It includes different concepts and patterns that I am experimenting with to enhance my understanding of:

- Observables and Operators
- Subjects (BehaviorSubject, ReplaySubject, etc.)
- Handling errors and retries in streams
- Creating custom operators
- Integrating RxJS with various frameworks and libraries

## Structure

This repository is organized as follows:

- **/exercises** - Contains small, self-contained exercises to demonstrate specific RxJS concepts.
- **/projects** - Larger projects where I apply RxJS to real-world scenarios.
- **/notes** - My notes and learnings from various resources on RxJS.

## How to Use

To get started with any project or exercise, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/rxjs-practice.git
